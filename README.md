# Stock_Trading_Simulator

This is a Basic Stock Trading Simulator created with the help of basic C++ Concepts like OOP Fundamentals and File Reading and Writing Concepts. 
The current version is without any GUI but I am looking forward to adding a layer of GUI over this.

The world of the stock market is looked upon as something very complex and difficult but with this training simulator,
I have tried to simplify all this to an extent as enough for beginners. A user would deal with static pre-defined stock prices and would trade them after knowing some basic terminologies.
