# Stock_Trading_Simulator

This is a Basic Stock Trading Simulator created with the help of basic C++ Concepts like 
OOP Fundamentals and File Reading and Writing Concepts . 
The current version is without any GUI but I am looking forward to add a layer of GUI over this . 

The world of stock market is looked upon as something very complex and difficult but with this training simulator 
I have tried to simplify all this to an extent as enough for biginners.
An user would deal with static pre-defined stock prices and would trade them after knowing some basic terminologies.
